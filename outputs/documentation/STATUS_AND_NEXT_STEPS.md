# Current Status & Next Steps

## Goal Review (from README)

**Primary Goal:** Automated sync system that transfers **all leads and conversations** from HeyReach to Attio CRM

### Required Features:
1. ✅ Sync all HeyReach leads to Attio
2. ✅ Prevent duplicates via LinkedIn URL matching
3. ❌ **Full conversation history** ← MISSING
4. ⚠️ Incremental updates for efficiency

---

## Current State

**Attio Database:**
- 124 people (source unclear - likely not from HeyReach sync)
- **0 messages** ← Problem!
- Sync state: Not updated (shows null)

**Last Sync Report (Oct 1, 20:31):**
```json
{
  "peopleRows": 5,
  "messageRows": 27,  ← Generated but NOT uploaded
  "threadRows": 5
}
```

**CSV Exports:**
- ✅ `people.csv` - 1.3 KB
- ✅ `messages.csv` - 20.8 KB ← Data exists!
- ✅ `threads.csv` - 34.1 KB

---

## Problem Identified

Messages are being **extracted from HeyReach** and **written to CSV**, but **NOT uploaded to Attio**.

### Possible Causes:

1. **Message upload disabled** in code
2. **Direction field validation failing**
3. **Person-to-message linking errors**
4. **API errors during message creation**

---

## Investigation Needed

### Step 1: Check Message Upload Code

Look at `heyreach-backfill.js` to see:
- Is message upload actually called?
- Is `AT_DISABLE_THREADS_UPSERT` set?
- Are there error logs for message creation?

### Step 2: Run Fresh Sync with Logging

```bash
# Clear everything first
node complete-cleanup.js

# Run sync with detailed logs
set MAX_LEADS=3
node heyreach-backfill.js 2>&1 | tee sync-debug.log
```

Watch for:
- "Created message" logs
- Any errors mentioning "direction" or "linkedin_messages"
- Person-to-message linking success

### Step 3: Verify Message Structure

Check if messages have required fields:
- `body` (required)
- `person` (reference to people)
- `sent_at` (timestamp)
- `direction` (Inbound/Outbound)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Debug Current Sync

1. Check `.env` for `AT_DISABLE_THREADS_UPSERT` or similar
2. Run test sync with 3 leads
3. Check console output for message creation
4. Verify in Attio UI if messages appear

### Option B: Verify Message Upload Logic

1. Read message upload code in `heyreach-backfill.js`
2. Check if Direction field is causing failures
3. Test creating a single message manually via API

### Option C: Start Clean

1. Clear Attio completely
2. Run fresh sync with verbose logging
3. Monitor each step (people → messages → links)

## What Should We Do?

**I recommend Option A + B:**

1. First, let me check the code to see if message upload is disabled
2. Then run a small test sync (3 leads) with logging
3. Debug based on what we find

**Do you want me to:**
- A) Investigate the code first?
- B) Run a test sync immediately?
- C) Something else?
