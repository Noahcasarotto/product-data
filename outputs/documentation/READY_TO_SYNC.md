# Ready to Sync - No Field Changes Needed!

## Discovery

After reviewing the actual sync code (`heyreach-backfill.js`), I found that **deduplication is already built-in**.

The script manually queries Attio for existing people BEFORE creating new ones:

```javascript
// Line 438-470: Search for existing person by LinkedIn URL
async function findPersonByLinkedInUrl(linkedinUrl) {
  const payload = {
    filter: { linkedin_url_6: linkedinUrl },
    limit: 1
  };
  // Returns existing person if found
}

// Line 625: Check before creating
const existingPerson = await findPersonByLinkedInUrl(row.linkedin_url);
if (existingPerson) {
  // UPDATE existing person with changes
} else {
  // CREATE new person
}
```

## What This Means

❌ **You DON'T need to enable uniqueness on any field**
- The script handles deduplication in code
- Queries Attio before each insert
- Updates existing records instead of creating duplicates

✅ **The ONLY field fix needed: Direction options**

---

## Just One Fix Required

### Add Direction Field Options

1. Open Attio → Settings → Objects & Records
2. Click **linkedin_messages** object
3. Find **"Direction"** field (type: select)
4. Click "Edit field"
5. Add two options:
   - `Inbound`
   - `Outbound`
6. Save

---

## Then Run Sync

### Test Sync (5 leads)
```bash
set MAX_LEADS=5
npm run heyreach:backfill
```

**Expected:**
- Creates 5 people
- Creates messages with direction set
- No duplicates

### Verify by Re-running
```bash
# Run again with same settings
npm run heyreach:backfill
```

**Expected:**
- Still only 5 people (not 10)
- Updates existing people if any data changed
- Console shows "No changes" or "Updated" messages

### Full Sync
```bash
set MAX_LEADS=10000
npm run heyreach:backfill
```

## How Deduplication Works

The code uses a **query-before-insert** pattern:

1. **For each lead from HeyReach:**
   - Query Attio: "Does a person with this `linkedin_url_6` already exist?"
   - If YES → Update that person's fields
   - If NO → Create new person

2. **Result:** No duplicates, even without uniqueness constraints

3. **Performance:** Cached lookups prevent repeated API calls

---

## Current State

✅ Attio empty (0 people, 0 messages)
✅ Sync state cleared
✅ `.env` configured correctly
✅ Deduplication logic already in code
⚠️ Direction field needs options added

---

## Summary

**You were right to question me** - the uniqueness fix was unnecessary.

The sync code **already prevents duplicates** through manual querying.

**Next step:** Add Direction field options in Attio UI, then sync.
